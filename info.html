"Boomers — the generation born roughly between 1946 and 1965 — scoff that millennials expect “participation trophies” for doing the bare minimum. Millennials say boomers are “out of touch.” Millennials (born roughly between 1980 and 1996) are “killing” once-stable industries like cereal by saving money, spending less, and “eating avocados” (Romano). It has gotten to the point where millenials (and Gen Z) find it nigh impossible to rationally argue with a baby boomer, knowing their track record of being stubborn and unwilling to listen to reason. As such, the younger generation has done what it has always done: create a meme out of it.</p>

                    <p class="textColumn">The usage of "Ok, boomer" has enraged many baby boomers on social media, with plenty misreading the quote terribly. A few have even compared the phrase to the n-word, which was (and still is) actually dehumanizing and considered a legitimate slur. Interestingly, not comprehending the meme is, as it turns out, the point of "Ok Boomer", Romano also writes. When did the meme start? How did it explode so quickly?</p>

However, it was used as early as September 3rd, 2015, on 4chan by an anonymous /r9k/ user. Starting in April 2018, the retort was used against politicians and memes criticizing millenials / Gen Z. Then, starting in January 2019, the retort took off and was given new life in the form of memes.

Below are a few examples of the meme at use.
