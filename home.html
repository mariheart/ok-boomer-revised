                <p>According to Aja Romano of Vox, the divide between millenial and baby boomers has only increased. "Boomers — the generation born roughly between 1946 and 1965 — scoff that millennials expect “participation trophies” for doing the bare minimum. Millennials say boomers are “out of touch.” Millennials (born roughly between 1980 and 1996) are “killing” once-stable industries like cereal by saving money, spending less, and “eating avocados” (Romano). It has gotten to the point where millenials (and Gen Z) find it nigh impossible to rationally argue with a baby boomer, knowing their track record of being stubborn and unwilling to listen to reason. As such, the younger generation has done what it has always done: create a meme out of it. </p>

                <p>The usage of "Ok, boomer" has enraged many baby boomers on social media, with plenty misreading the quote terribly. Not comprehending the meme is, as it turns out, the point of "Ok Boomer", Romano also writes. When did the meme start? How did it explode so quickly? And what does this mean for the future of intergenerational communication? <a class="moreInfoLink" href="info.html">Click here to learn more!</a></p>
